            India is a country prosperous in knowledge, a nation with the population as an asset where one-fifth of the
            total population is youth. A land of sages and seers, scholars, and scientists. A cultural, secular,
            democratic landmass, among one of the world`s largest economies, is facing an educational crisis. Even the
            brilliant minds of the country are migrating to foreign countries or they are in peril due to mental stress.
            The education system is sleeping, not aware of the fact, that a catastrophe has struck the future. India is
            enrolling itself in a list of countries with maximum youth suicides. Because of the negligence of the
            education system, the literacy rate has gone down to 74.04%. <br><br>
            The young adults aren’t receiving the kind of treatment and appreciation they should from their teachers and
            authorities. They raise their voice against any issue their mouths are being shut by the authorities,
            blackmailing them for not giving their degrees. For example, in engineering, students are dying to get their
            admissions in the topmost IITs of the country and when they reach there, they do not know why they have
            enrolled in engineering. They then explore other options, look for different fields, and discover
            themselves. What is the use? By the time they will graduate, their 4 years would be gone. Now what?
            Rediscover oneself? <br><br>

            The system should be such that, the students must be interviewed or counseled in the schools, or by their
            parents before taking a major decision of what they want to do. It should not be like blindly following the
            crowd. There are so many college dropouts in the country, who have finally discovered the true motives of
            their lives. If a student enrolled in engineering, for example later finds out he or she is not interested
            anymore in the field, the institute should keep an option to change department or branch in any of the
            subsequent years, or if a person couldn`t afford to go to a university but has an intellect, then there
            should be a common exam for everyone conducted by the government, to ensure that a person is a graduate
            without attending college. Because people do have intellect, but not the money to enroll in grand institutes
            or universities. The +2 programs should be such that students must be counseled regularly by the teachers
            and parents if they are enjoying what they are doing and studying. Collectively we can solve the problems.
            There are many fortunate enough to attend schools but do not want to and there are many who want to go to
            schools or colleges but cannot. We need to really look after what is going on inside, rather than sitting in
            air-conditioned offices and sip tea. People studying in JNU, doing post-graduation in the South East Asian
            studies, cannot point Balochistan on the map! Civil engineers from premium institutes do not even know about
            the foundation of a bridge! Electrical engineers cannot make a circuit and electronic engineers cannot tell
            a difference between a chip and a transformer! <br><br>

            This is the reality of our country`s education system. What are we doing? A very challenging job, NOTHING.
