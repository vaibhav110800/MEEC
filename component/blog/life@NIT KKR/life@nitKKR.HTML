        <div class="blogContent">
            Approx of 170 km far from the administrative capital of India that is New Delhi there exists a small
            district of the Indian state Haryana called Kurukshetra. It is a semiurban district but has a highly
            importance in Hindu Mythology, and approx 6 kms from the railway station of kurukshetra there comes an
            engineering college National Institute of technology, Kurukshetra abbreviated as NITKKR. NITKKR has acquired
            7th rank in NIRF rankings amongst all NITs in India and 42nd rank amongst the all acadmics institutions all
            over India. So today we will be looking into the journey of four years of a student who has reached here
            after clearing the hinderence of the so called one of the toughest competetive exams in India named as JEE
            MAINS for entering in the engineering field. <br><br>

            So let's begin!<br><br>

            At the gate of the college we saw written there on the walls 'NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY KURUKSHETRA'
            and you feel an amazing stimulation in your body,at the gate the guard stops you for checking. After
            entering in the college you can feel a sudden change in the atmosphere and environment. After all the
            processes of admission, you are allotted with your hostel which is your second home and the 'adda' of all
            the bak*****s' first and now congrats you are an integral part of NITKKR for four years.<br><br>

            At the very first day at hostel you are busy in observing the things all around and understanding the
            function and operations of the hostel, the warden will treat you as you are his own son only for
            sometime.Now you can boast on your school friends and tell them every single details ki yaar mera hostel
            aisa hai,, waisa hai,, yaha aisa hota hai waisa hota h.. And ect.. Etc..<br><br>

            You found the mess food very tasty and nutritional but only for couple of weeks. And now tomorrow is your
            first college day so you are very much excited and nervous too.<br><br>

            At the morning of the next day you get ready and rush to your college academic block with the security
            guards escorting you as you are the President and have much much confusion after getting the routine and the
            code of the subjects.<br><br>

            You see the seniors of 2nd , 3rd, 4th year and thinks that they are the idol and I will follow them in my
            college life but after some time you also gets converted like them and know it very well that sab moh maya
            hai.<br><br>

            In the college the profie's introduces you to the college and it's different areas and tell you about them
            as our college has an area of 300 acres and it's branches are the biggest among all the North Indians
            colleges . And you gets very overhelmed and thinks that i am so lucky that I have got admitted in such a big
            and prestigious institution. But it's just a halocination.<br><br>

            And now your daily routine is start going to library and collecting the books on the identity card and
            thinking that it's a very big library.<br><br>

            And now one of the desire after entering the college is to make girlfriend but girls in the engineering
            colleges just like 'unth ke muh me jeera' So your competition begins here and s boys try to talk to girls
            and try to impress them some got success but most of of them do not and then they satisfy themselves
            accepting them as friends but still have a strong desire to get a girlfriend.<br><br>

            The first semester is invested in understanding the college and making new friends and developing good and
            bad habits. In the first semester you are very much sincere and concerned about you studies and study hard
            thinking that you will get a good placement and become a good engineer but its just the beginning of life in
            engineering college. In the academics you are introduced with a new way of learning and teaching with
            advance laboratories and practicals of physics and chemistry.The most annoying but interesting period of
            sports and education in which we have to wear white and navy blue dress with shoes and perform yoga and
            running. Now coming to the sessional examinations, they have a unique excitement, fear, stress and we can
            also say hope and expectations in the first semester, all students study very hard ,learn all the chapters
            line by line word by word very sincerely and seriously but as the semester passes and they get to know about
            the reality. Then they only study one night before the examination and if we talk about the back benchers
            they ask the syllabus a day before examination and study only the most important points which are likely to
            come in examination and the rest they leave it on the teacher and of course on the god and this practice
            gets perfect after the passage of every semester when we talk about the nightlife of the first especially
            the boys hostels it just like mixture of activities going on such as someone is playing pubg aur other
            mobile games others are studying, someone is talking to to to his parents and others are talking to their
            girlfriends and the majority of students grouped together and have their discussion on different topics such
            as the bad management and administration of the college, topics of national intrest, plans of future, thier
            college crush, crush on teacher, explaining about the most beautiful girl of the class, someone tells about
            his ex girlfriends and there are endless topics on which the discussion goes on.. Till 3 to 4 am. And then
            in the morning the daily routine starts.<br><br>

            The most facinating things come when the inductions of clubs and society starts. Being in one club or
            society is must to survive in college, after hearing this, students gets influenced by them and rush to the
            LHC at 4.30 and try to give their best interviews to get selected in their preferred society and clubs and
            they end by entering in multiple clubs deep inside both the interviewer and the students knows that we are
            making stupid to each other by promising that we will be always available for the society or club and can to
            anyting and everything for them. But this induction is a starting of and wonderful endless journey of
            senior- junior relationship that never ends. This is the most important and amazing part of college life
            that you get in touch with amazing seniors who guides you as their own sibling and give you the best of best
            advices.<br><br>

            Coming to the anther part of the college life which are fests, it is the most awaited events in the college
            for many students.
            Fests are basically an opportunity for the boys to get in touch with their crushes in different ways and
            impress them. These fests are only for three type of students.

            1. Who have crush they try to impress them and try to make their partner.

            2. Who have neither any plans for the fests nor crushes or girlfriends they find fests simply a three to
            four day vacation and they go to their homes and have nothing to do in the fests.

            3. The determined toward the club or society students they move or rush to whole college and conduct the
            events of the clubs and society and at last they get noting except a membership certificate and some amount
            for food and money a and little bit apprecation from the senior for good work .<br><br>

            After the first year when you are in second year you feel like you are now the most knowledgeable man of the
            college and you know everything and when you come in contact with new freshies you act like the supreme boss
            you order them to say you sir and talk to you with respect and honourly.<br><br>

            You have constructed a very good friend circle and have already done lots of bak*****s and many more are yet
            to come in the journey of remaing 3 years. In the mid of second year you start preparing for your future,
            some start preparing for ESE/GATE/ IAS .Some students of CS /EC/IT starts thinking and dreaming of doing job
            in Google/Microsoft/flipkart/adobe/Amazon and other big IT sector company and few students still figuring
            out their future and on the question of what's your plan after college they answer that fistly I want to
            enjoy the college life but deep inside they know they have still no plans afer the college.<br><br>

            Talking about a couple life in the college they experience the best life amonst the all students
            They have the maximum attendance in the class, they come with matching dresses and their only work in the
            class is to stare at each other and pointing to someone with their eyes and then giving a little smile to
            each other and then suddenly focusing to the blackboard.and after class moving to have some juice at juice
            centre inside the college or outside the campus and after wandering here and there in the college in the
            evening they then starts finding the darkest place in the college 'you very well know why' and after this
            they hold each other's hand move to drop the girl at the lovers point which we called 'piya milan chowk' and
            they hug each other in the manner that this is their last meetings and they will never meet again in their
            entire life. Library is a place for reading and learning new things but for couples it's a place to get to
            know about each other and grooming their love and spending looking into each others and talking infinitely.
            Sharing past life stories.<br><br>

            One sections are of those students who are so called the DR or dedicated towards the engineering they follow
            each and every instruction of the teachers completing every single assignment on time doing as per teacher
            and Remebering and reading each topic everyday, assisting other students in completing their practicle
            files, telling them the important questions of viva and many academic related help.<br><br>

            Do you remember sillencer from 3 idiots..?? Yes these creatures also exist but in a modified way they try to
            be the so called chamcha of the professors and always seek to impress the professor and score hood marks and
            don't leave any opportunity to get even a single mark stating their own logic to the answer and
            explainations.<br><br>

            The college administration declares themselves as a college of zero tolerance against ragging and a ragging
            free campus in its brochure but when you spend months in college you will find that there operates different
            GTs and they informaly use to ragging students on the name of personality development and making you ready
            for public speaking and deep inside it's true that little bit ragging to the students help to sparkle their
            personality and making them fearless and preparing them ready for facing all harsh situation of
            engineering.<br><br>

            After the successful organization of the college fests each and every society throws after fest parties
            these are also for called freshers party as we welcome first year students into the clubs and society to
            make them feel special and important for the clubs and societies.<br><br>

            Placements to a good company is a dream of every student in the college and when someone is placed to a
            company his happiness level raches to the seventh sky and why not the goal of coming to this college has now
            Achieved. Going to placement cell for interview is the most difficult walk for students but when you see
            your name on the list of placed students you are on top of the world. Then your friends beat you with the
            belts till you feel the satisfaction or the jealousy has vanished of your friend then placed students throws
            a good party to their juniors and classmates.
            Going into the bitter truth of the college that there happened a huge number of sucides upto 10 to 15 since
            last 3 years as the students have taken this bad and wrong step for themselves, all engineering college are
            cursed with this. There is some fault in our educaton system this needs to be corrected with some immediate
            steps so that such needed lives can be saved.<br><br>

            On the conclusion it can be said that an engineering period is the best period for a student where you enjoy
            and experience all the things of a life in a very short period of time. And these four year remains the
            unforgettable days of your life.
