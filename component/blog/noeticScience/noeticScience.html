            Ever thought of bending a spoon by focusing? Do you think the mind can interact with matter? Does science
            support such weird stage magic tricks? What do you think? <br><br>



            Well, this is possible! Noetic science answers the wizardry of the thought 'As you think you shall be'. The
            Institute of Noetic Sciences describes noetic sciences as "how beliefs, thoughts, and intentions affect the
            physical world". It can tear the fabric of space and time and let our thoughts propel and swim in the ocean
            of reality. Where reality interacts with intellect, where you can make stage tricks happen without deceiving
            the eyes of spectators, where the mind meets the matter!<br><br>

            So.....does that mean if we visualize something, we can do it? Are we drawing some power from the universe
            or the chakras to heal or bend reality?<br><br>



            The thing is, the more we focus, the clearer the picture, more likely are the chances to make things happen
            at our own will while doing that our mind interacts with the energy or matter around or in more scientific
            terms our thoughts interact with the photons and make things work just like we want them to be.<br><br>



            Between 2008 and 2016, a series of experiments were conducted by the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) to
            explore possible mental interactions with photons. These experiments were motivated by the quantum theory
            concept that a “nonphysical factor” (i.e., consciousness) was required to cause the transition between
            quantum potential states and classical actual states. What does that mean? It means the consciousness and/or
            the mind has the capacity to influence matter — also known as mind-matter Interaction. The experiments used
            a double-slit apparatus (which is used to track the trajectory of light) to measure whether a person’s
            focused attention on perceiving or perturbing one of the two-photon paths changed the photo (light)
            trajectory. Overall, the results of those experiments suggested that focused attention does appear to affect
            the pattern of light.<br><br>



            With those results in mind, IONS conducted two more experiments (2015-2016) to see if focused attention
            could affect another property of photons: spin. The test apparatus consisted of a laser beam sent first
            through a horizontal polarizer (an optical filter that lets light waves of a specific polarization pass
            through while blocking light waves of other polarizations) and then through a vertical polarizer in a
            light-tight box. In such a system, very little light should pass through the second polarizer unless
            something affects photon spin in the space between the two polarizers. The hypothesis was that focusing
            human attention between the two polarizers while holding the intention to twist the light beam might cause
            an increase in the amount of light passing through the second polarizer. Both of the exploratory experiments
            yielded significant but surprising results: Focused attention resulted in less light passing through the
            second polarizer while mentally concentrating on the beam. While this serendipitous discovery suggested that
            the mind might be able to alter the way light behaves, the outcome warranted further exploration to
            determine what caused the laser beam illumination level to decrease instead of increase.<br><br>



            This was the question motivating the present experiment: Where did the photons go? And specifically, could
            the mind be conceived as a kind of “matter” or “energy” that interacts with photons? The assumption of both
            the double-slit and the photon spin experiments was that focused attention directly interacted with light in
            some way. But how, exactly?<br><br>



            Wanting to investigate this further, members of the Science Team at IONS just completed a study to explore
            what might have happened to the “missing photons” associated with the decline in light. They hypothesized
            that focused attention might slightly deflect the light beam, causing some photons to scatter from their
            original trajectory. They built a device with sensors that recorded both the original laser beam power and
            scattered light, with the prediction that the data from the two sensors would show that as the beam
            illumination declined, scattered light would increase, and vice versa.<br><br>



            The uncharted domains of science are unfolding, solving the puzzles and putting the pieces in the right
            place. It opens the gateway of the unknown mystic creativity of nature, who knows if it will lead us to our
            own Hogwarts;)
